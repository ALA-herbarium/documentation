# Annotation labels on a specimen

## New determination annotation

These should be added as additional taxonomic identifications

## Other annotations

These should be added as new _parts_ of type _media_ contained within
the herbarium sheet _container_. To create:

 * Click on Parts tab in the operator's record view
 * In the “Add Specimen Part” form:
    * Part Name = “media” 
    * Count = 1
    * Disposition = “in collection”
    * Condition = ... probably “good”
    * Remarks = **Enter label text here**. Prefix with “Paper label:” to
      indicate that this is the type of media.
    * AddToContainerBarcode = copy the barcode of the **herbarium
      sheet** from the panel above. “H123...”
 * Click “Create Part”
 * Return to the main Specimen view and you should see the new part in
   the “Parts” table.  See, e.g.,
   [UAM:Herb:40073](https://arctos.database.museum/guid/UAM:Herb:40073)
   
The annotation label contents can now be searched on in the main
Arctos Catalog Search. Enter the search terms in the “Part Search”
search box of the Parts section of the form.
