# History and current status of the ALAAC identifier series

A giant binder known as the ALAAC book contains pages recording
the allocation of subseries of ALAAC numbers to particular accession
sets, or collections by particular people.  These pages are being
scanned and the photos named to reflect the ALAAC subseries within
them - See the GDrive. There are five prefix formations:

**No prefix** The ALA accession (ALAAC) series was started at ‘1’ for
collections in the 1950s, with no prefix. These continued until
1981. The last ‘no prefix’ number is 99056. This series contained
vascular plants and cryptogams. In the main pages, the moss subseries
were noted only as “Mosses”, but on separate “Bryophyte” pages the
details of these subseries were given. For example, on page 2 of the
main pages, subseries 7426-7659 were marked as Mosses, but on page 1
of the Bryophyte pages, subseries 7426-7659 are listed as from
“Shelter - Interior Alaska, etc”.  Towards the end of the ‘no prefix’
series, mosses and lichen subseries were no longer noted in the main
list, but the numbers were simply missing. The subseries appeared only
on the bryophyte and lichen pages.  

The last moss subseries was: 98774-98836 in 1982.  The last lichen
subseries was 98727-98772 in 1982.

In March 1982 the total number of allocated subseries numbers were
calculated for vascular (68,725), bryophytes (variously 18067, 17895,
17832 - unclear which), lichens (9709) and the new prefix series used
the next number from this total as the starting number.

**V** Starting March 1982 with **V68726**. 

**B** Starting March 1982 with **B18042**

**L** Starting March 1982 with **L9710**   
   
**A**

   different pages.
