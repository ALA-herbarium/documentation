# Fungi or cryptogam paper packets

To make the packet:

 * Select in Arctos the set of catalog records to print
 * Send records to the Arctos Reporter. The report called
   `uam_myco_packet_label_2024` is working well.
 * A PDF should open in your browser. Either print directly from the
   browser, or download the PDF and print from a printing application.
 * Preload the printer with archival-quality paper. The paper should
   not be too thick as it will be hard for thicker specimens to cause
   a ‘bulge’ in the packet.
 * Score the packets, using the paper cutter (guillotine) guidelines and
    sharp edge: 
    1. Measure 3.5 inches from the bottom of the page, and carefully
       bend down the paper to make the fold-score above the label (start in
       the middle and bend the paper, then slide your fingers to one side, 
       then the other).
    2. Measure 3.5 inches from the top of the paper, and bend the paper to 
       make the pocket. Do not fold the paper into thirds, as in a letter.
    3. With the printing face up, turn the (open) paper 90 degrees and line 
       up the edge of the paper with the 7 inch guideline. Bend down the paper 
       to make one edge fold-score of 1.5 inch.
    4. Repeat on the other side.
 * Now fold at the scores to create the packet:
    1. Fold up the inner flap
    2. Fold in the sides
    3. Fold down the top
    4. Carefully adjust the folds then press hard with fingers or a bottle to 
       make the folds sharp and permanent.
 * The finished packet should be 5.5 inches wide and 4 inches tall.
 * Stick the barcode on the back of the packet, centered in the
   middle, ~2 mm from the top edge, oriented to be upright when the
   packet is standing vertically on its lower edge.
   
To load the packet:

 * Open up the packet completely.
 * Lay a card (pre-cut to 3.5 × 5.25 inches) in the middle.
 * Overlay with a 3 × 4 inch piece of cushioning cotton
 * Place specimen material on top of the cushion
 * Carefully fold the package. Allow the front to bulge as needed
