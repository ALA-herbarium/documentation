# Arctos batch/bulkload operations

## Batch update records using the Manage Menu

 * Navigate to the main Search page, search for records that all require the same change, i.e. add collector. Click Submit Query. Tip: customize your search page to include 'GUID' textbox to search using an item guid.
 * Review that record list is correct (if incorrect, to remove or add from the entries list modify your original search list).
 * Just above the entries list click on the [ Tools ] dropdown menu, and select appropriate value listed under **_Manage_**, i.e. **_Manage_** > Collectors
 * A new browser tab will open with entries from above search, and selected action, i.e. Add/Remove collectors for all catalog records listed below with **_Name_**, **_Role_**, and **_Order_** options.
 * Input appropriate values to be added/removed/updated to entire batch, select appropriate submit button, i.e. 'Insert Agent'
