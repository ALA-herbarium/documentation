# Arctos one-by-one operations

## Adding a barcode to a specimen

 * Stick the physical barcode onto the herbarium sheet
 * Locate the specimen record in Arctos
 * Go to “Part Location” in the menu bar
 * Click in the “whole organism” box in the tree diagram. There should
   only be one higher step: “The Universe”
 * Click on “Edit this container” on the right
 * Either type or scan the sheet barcode into the “Move To Barcode”
   field (above “Print”, “Delete container” ...)
 * Click “Save Container Edits”
 * Go back to the main specimen page and reload. Revisit the “Part
   Location”. You should now see that the “whole organism” is now
   contained in a “herbarium sheet” with the correct barcode (shown
   between brackets), and that herbarium sheet is contained with “The
   Universe”

Note: for this to work, the herbarium sheet container needs to have
been created previously, usually in the ‘Bulk Edit Container’ tool.
